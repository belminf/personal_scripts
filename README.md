# backup_scripts

Scripts I use to backup my homedir and cloud data to rsync.net.

Archlinux is my main distro so a lot of this is catered to that.

## Pre-requisites
* `rsync` - Used to backup to rsync.net
* `git` - Used to pull Github repos
* `rclone` - Used for GDrive backup
* `getmail` - Used to backup Gmail

## Setup
Create `.environment` based off `.environment.example`
